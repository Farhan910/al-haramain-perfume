          This note carries a soft yet deep scent that has the capability to attract people with its own charm. There was a time when Musk was derived from the gland of a species of deers. Back then, almost 40 deer glands could produce 1 kilogram of musk. And to get 40 male deers with musk, they had to kill almost 160 deers.
